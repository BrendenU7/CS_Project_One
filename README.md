# CS_Project_One

The Airgead Banking Investment Application was developed to help users understand the power of compound interest and how investments grow over time. The application allows users to input their initial investment amount, monthly deposit, annual interest rate, and the number of years for the investment. It then calculates and displays the year-end balance and interest both with and without additional monthly deposits. This interactive system is intended to teach concepts of fiscal responsibility and the benefits of investing.
Areas of Achievement
I did particularly well in designing the object-oriented structure of the application. By encapsulating the investment calculation logic within a dedicated class, I ensured that the code was modular and easy to maintain. The use of clear and descriptive method names, along with in-line comments, contributed to the readability and understandability of the code.
Areas for Enhancement
Error Handling: Implementing comprehensive error handling would make the program more robust. For example, checking for invalid inputs and prompting the user to re-enter values if necessary.
Optimization: The performance of the application could be improved by optimizing the calculation logic, especially for large inputs. This might involve more efficient algorithms or data structures.
Areas Challenges and Solutions
One of the most challenging aspects of the project was ensuring accurate calculations for compound interest, especially when monthly deposits were involved. To overcome this, I thoroughly reviewed financial formulas and tested the calculations with various inputs to ensure accuracy. Additionally, using resources such as online tutorials and documentation on financial calculations greatly helped my implementation.
Transferable Skills
The skills developed during this project are highly transferable to other projects and coursework:
Object-Oriented Programming: The ability to design and implement classes and objects is fundamental to many programming tasks.
Modular Design: Breaking down a program into manageable components makes development and maintenance more efficient.
Problem-Solving: Tackling the challenges of accurate financial calculations and user input validation has enhanced my problem-solving abilities.
Maintainability, Readability, and Adaptability
To ensure the program is maintainable, readable, and adaptable:

In-Line Comments: I included comments throughout the code to explain the purpose of various sections and specific lines, making it easier for others (and my future self) to understand the logic.
Consistent Naming Conventions: Using clear and consistent naming conventions for variables, methods, and classes enhances readability.
Modular Code Structure: By organizing the code into separate files and classes, I made it easier to modify and extend the program in the future.
